# Pyber-Challenge- The purpose of this analysis is to breakdown data from different types of areas in a city to determine which area had more fares and more ride sharing based on the average fares of each city type. 
The results of the Pyber Challenge analysis concluded that the urban fares has the most increase that was steady to an average of about $2300, while the other city types such as suburban an rural areas had substantial declines with the fares in the city throught out the months. 
A few business recommendations to help with disparities in each city type could be:
1. Hire more drivers in the suburban and rural areas
2. Increase the fares in the rural cities
3. Get more drivers and longer rides in the urban communities.
